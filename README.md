# UBS AURA
*AURA Advise, Understand, Reflect, Act  - Wealth that learns you, Advice that evolves with you.*

PolyFinTech100 API Hackathon 2025: Smart Wealth Management Official Submission for Team Tweaking. Our solution is a **standalone wealth management application** that the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) can adopt as part of its digital ecosystem. The platform will serve as a **centralised hub** for High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) seeking a simplified yet comprehensive view of their entire financial portfolio by consolidating information across multiple banks and financial institutions through a **Personal Online Datastore (POD)**. Since we cannot access customer-specific information from other banks, this app will instead **consolidate anonymised and aggregated data**, presented through **contextualised statements**. Our **Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine** will then process these statements to generate objective insights, simplified analytics, and a clear overview tailored to the needs of HNWIs with complex financial structures. View the [Full Proposed Solution]() for a more comprehensive explanation.
